## Example Disk Images ##
There are two formats of ROMWBW disk 512 and 1K 

You can have up to two disks loaded, but they must both be of the same format. 

These need referancing in your RC2040.ini 

YOU MUST use the associated CPMIDE.id file and disdefs that match the format of the files. 

You can't use two disks with different formats at the same time.
